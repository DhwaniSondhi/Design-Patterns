# Design-Patterns
"Each pattern describes a problem which occurs over and over again in our environment, and then describes the core of the solution to that problem, in such a way that you can use this solution a million times over, without ever doing it the same way twice.” **Christopher Alexander – late 1970s**<br />
They are solutions to general software development problems. <br />
In general, a pattern has four essential elements:

- **The pattern name:** The pattern name is a handle we can use to describe a design problem, its solutions, and consequences in a word or two. 
- **The problem:** The problem describes when to apply the pattern.
- **The solution:** The solution describes the elements that make up the design, their relationships, responsibilities, and collaborations. 
- **The consequences:** The consequences are the results and trade-offs of applying the pattern.

This repository describes a few design patterns and their use in various problems.<br />
**Please refer to specific design pattern README.md for more details.**
